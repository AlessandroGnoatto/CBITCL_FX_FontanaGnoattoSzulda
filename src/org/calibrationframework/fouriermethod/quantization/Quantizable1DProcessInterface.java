/**
 * Interface representing the Fourier-based quadratic quantization (order 2), of a scalar random variable standing for the evaluation at "maturity",
 * of a one-dimensional underlying process (CalibrableProcessInterface model) whose characteristic function is known in closed-form (required for setting up).
 * This one then contains the optimal (or sub-optimal, stationary) quantization grid (quantizer) for some level of the state variable.
 * It also contains the corresponding Voronoi quantization of the variate,
 * along with its companions weights describing its law over the associated grid.
 * Likewise, it provides the resulting quantization error between the variate and its quantization.
